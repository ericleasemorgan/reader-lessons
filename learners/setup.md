## Data Sets

We will be using a dataset comprised of [Homer's Iliad and Odyssey as translated by Samuel Butler](http://library.distantreader.org/carrels/homer/study-carrel.zip). 


## Software Setup

Software setup ought to be, at most, a two-step process ("famous last words"):

   1. Make sure a sane verion of Python is installed on your computer, and if you don't know how to address such a thing, then it is strongly suggested you [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). 
   
   2. From the command line, install a set of Python-based command-line tools called the Distant Reader Toolbox: `pip install reader-toolbox`.
