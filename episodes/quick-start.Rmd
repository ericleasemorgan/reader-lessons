## On your mark. Get set. Go!

Once you have installed the Toolbox, there are quite a number of commands you can use for the purposes of analyzing ("reading") a corpus. Here are just a few of them:

   * `rdr` - to output a menu of all commands
   
   * `rdr --help` - same as above, and remember, `--help` can be appended to any `rdr` command; for example: `rdr download --help`, `rdr concordance --help`, or `rdr ngrams --help`
   
   * `rdr set -s local` - denote the location of your Distant Reader data sets ("study carrels"); for now, accept the default
   
   * `rdr download homer` - download a previously created study carrel and save it in your local library
