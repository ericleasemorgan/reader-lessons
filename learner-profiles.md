   * Cynthia is a rising junior in the English department who is interested in exploring natural language processing to build a portfolio website when she applies for graduate school. 

   * Ted is a Data Librarian who often has students contact him for help developing text analysis projects. He’d like to learn more about the tools that already exist so that he can teach them to students.

   * Fu is a graduate student in the Statistics department. He normally works with numeric data, but is being asked to do a natural language processing project as part of his campus job with the Library.

   * Minahil is a senior researcher with a career in the digital humanities. She is new to natural language processing and wants to learn about the different kinds of tools available to her for a computational analysis of e.e. cummings poetry. 

   * Dillworth is the director of a scientific lab. For the purposes of writing a literature review, he has accumulated 200 journal articles on his specific topic, and now he wants to garner a thorough understanding of the articles’ content.

   * Susan is an undergraduate student taking Philosophy 101, and there are a large number of assigned readings. She understands the strengths of traditional reading, but she also understands how computers can be used to supplement the traditional reading process. She wants to use the Reader to provide that supplement.

   * Arnau is a Ph.D. student, and there are hundreds of items in his bibliography. He wants to use the computational techniques to remind himself of trends he has noticed as well as to highlight trends of which he might not be aware.

   * Claudia is a Victorian Literature scholar, and she believes both the gender of authors as well as the decade written are indicators of subgenres within the Literature. She wants to apply distant reading techniques to her corpus in order to verify this claim.
